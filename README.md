Subset of data for ch2 of my dissertation of effects of passage through gopher tortoise guts on seed germinability.

These data are collected from an experiment conducted on the effects of gut passage by gopher tortoises on seed germinability (germination percentage and time to germination. Both gut-passed seeds and seeds that did not pass through the gut were planted "clean" and with scat. This was done to determine if it was indeed gut passage that altered germinability, or if simply being in the presence of animal droppings caused altered germintion.

R scripts provide code for modelling and plotting these data.
